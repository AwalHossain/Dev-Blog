# Dev-Blog

**Description:** Dev-Blog is a user-friendly blog site featuring several blogs on various topics related to development. The site utilizes a grid system to display all the blogs, allowing users to filter and sort them based on their preferences. Users can also like and save blogs for reading later. This project is built using React, Node.js, MongoDB, RTK Query, and TypeScript. Note that the site is still a work in progress, with additional features such as commenting, authentication, and the ability to add new blogs planned for future development.

## Features

- **Grid System:** Display all blogs in an organized grid layout.
- **Filtering:** Users can filter blogs based on their preferences.
- **Sorting:** Blogs can be sorted by newest addition, most liked, and default.
- **Like and Save:** Users can like blogs and save them for later reading.
- **Upcoming Features:** Commenting, authentication, and the ability to add new blogs are planned for future releases.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Express / Node.js
- Mongoose / MongoDB
- Redux Toolkit (RTK Query)
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

## Usage

1. **Grid System Benefits:** Explore the advantages of using a grid system to display blogs on your website. Discuss how this layout improves visual appeal and organization, making it easier for users to navigate through different blog posts.

2. **Filtering Options:** Elaborate on the filtering options available on the website. Explain how these filters enhance the user experience by allowing users to narrow down their search based on specific criteria, such as topic, author, or date.

## Optimizations

In future versions, the following enhancements are planned:

- **Commenting:** Enable users to comment on others' posts.
- **Post Updates:** Allow authors to update their posts.
- **Improved UI:** Enhance the user interface for creating posts.
- **Advanced Search:** Implement an improved search function.
- **Testing:** Include test files to ensure the reliability of the application.

## Lessons Learned

During the development of Dev-Blog, I learned to use RTK Query to manage state with Redux. Although RTK Query presented some challenges during the learning process, it streamlined the code significantly, eliminating the need for extensive Axios requests. This experience has equipped me with valuable knowledge in state management and API integration.
